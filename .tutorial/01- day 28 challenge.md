# üëâ Day 28 Challenge

**Use Day 27's character generator for this project...to build an automated game battle system!**

- Add `return` functions to your character's health and strength statuses from Day 27's project.
- Generate two different characters and store their data (health and strength stats, character type, name, etc.).
- Use a `while True` loop to simulate those two characters battling.
- Roll one six-sided dice for both characters. The character who rolls the higher amount wins that round.
- The winner of that round (the one who rolled the higher number) will give damage to the other character by doing the following:
  - Find the *difference* between the strength of both opponents and *add one*.
  - Take that amount *away* from the *loser's health*.
- At the end of each round, check the stats of each character to ensure neither of them have died yet.
- When one character dies (they run out of health), declare a winner of the battle!
- To keep this battle from looking hideous between rounds use `time.sleep` to pause between rounds `os.system("clear")` to ensure the screen clears between battles.

Extra points for the use of emojis, colors, or even sound code!

<details> <summary> üí° Hints </summary>

- Start with the code you created from Day 27.
- Keep the same subroutines as Day 27 and add one more subroutine about character damage (how a winner is declared in each round).
- Tweak the `while` loop from Day 27 to introduce the first character and their stats followed by the character they will battle and that character's stats. (You will want to include pausing and clearing of the code as you did on Day 27).
- Create a counter (within the loop) to keep track of the winner for each round.
- Create another `while` loop *inside* the current `while` loop with `if` statements, pausing, and clearing of code to show what happens if character 1 wins, the characters tie, etc.
- Make sure you give a recap of the health each character has left after each round.
